# wrangle-and-analyse
This repository is for the wrangling project of the Udacity's Data Analyst Course. Here, I will be gathering data from Twitter API to draw insights.

For this project, I will be using the following Python Packages to help:
* pandas
* NumPy
* requests
* tweepy
* json

Files in this project:
* `twitter-archive-enhanced.csv` - CSV file with Twitter Archive for WeRateDogs (this was provided by Udacity)
* `image-predictions.tsv` - TSV file with image predictions which is based on WeRateDogs (again, provided by Udacity)
* `tweet_json.txt` - TXT file with tweets gathered using Twitter's API
* `wrangle_act-Copy1.ipynb` - Notebook with code used for wrangling and analysing
* `twitter_archive_master.csv` - Master CSV file with final cleaned dataset
* `wrangle_report.html` - Brief report detailing wrangling part of project
* `act_report.pdf` - Report about insights found during analysis
